                    Help in Python is always available right in the interpreter. If you want to know how an object
                    works,
                    all you have to do is call <span class="gray">help(&ltobject&gt)</span>! Also useful are <span
                        class="gray">dir()</span>,
                    which shows you all the
                    object’s methods, and <span class="gray">&ltobject&gt.__doc__</span>, which
                    shows you its documentation string:
                </p>
                <code>
                >>> help(5)
                Help on int object:
                (etc etc)

                <p>Python has <span class="dark">no mandatory statement termination characters</span> and <span
                        class="dark">blocks are specified by indentation.</span>
                    Indent to begin a block, dedent to end one. Statements that expect an indentation level end in a
                    colon (:). <span class="dark">Comments</span> start with the pound (#) sign and are single-line,
                    multi-line strings are used
                    for <span class="dark">multi-line comments. Values are assigned</span> (in fact, objects are <span

                    sign (“=”), and <span class="dark">equality testing</span> is done using two equals signs (“==”).
                    You can increment/decrement
                    values using the += and -= operators respectively by the right-hand amount. This works on many
                    datatypes, strings included. You can also use multiple variables on one line. For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    >>> myvar = 3

                    # It doesn't violate strong typing because values aren't

            <article>
                <p>
                    The data structures available in python are lists, tuples and dictionaries. Sets are available in
                    the <span class="gray">sets</span> library (but are built-in in Python 2.5 and later). Lists are
                    like one-dimensional arrays
                    (but you can also have lists of other lists), dictionaries are associative arrays (a.k.a. hash
                    tables) and tuples are immutable one-dimensional arrays (Python “arrays” can be of any type, so you
                    can mix e.g. integers, strings, etc in lists/dictionaries/tuples). The index of the first item in
                    all array types is 0. Negative numbers count from the end towards the beginning, -1 is the last
                    item. Variables can point to functions. The usage is as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
                >>> sample = [1, ["another", "list"], ("a", "tuple")]
                >>> mylist = ["List item 1", 2, 3.14]
                >>> mylist[0] = "List item 1 again" # We're changing the item.
                >>> mylist[-1] = 3.21 # Here, we refer to the last item.
                >>> mydict = {"Key 1": "Value 1", 2: 3, "pi": 3.14}
                >>> mydict["pi"] = 3.15 # This is how you change dictionary values.
                >>> mytuple = (1, 2, 3)
                >>> myfunction = len
                >>> print(myfunction(mylist))
                3
            </code>
                <p>You can access <span class="dark">array ranges</span> using a colon (:). Leaving the start index
                    empty assumes the first item,
                    leaving the end index assumes the last item. Indexing is inclusive-exclusive, so specifying
                    <span class="gray">[2:10]</span>
                    will return items <span class="gray">[2]</span> (the third item, because of 0-indexing) to <span
                        class="gray">[9]</span> (the tenth item), inclusive (8
                    items). Negative indexes count from the last item backwards (thus -1 is the last item) like so:
                </p>
                <code>
                >>> mylist = ["List item 1", 2, 3.14]
                >>> print(mylist[:])
                ['List item 1', 2, 3.1400000000000001]
                >>> print(mylist[0:2])
                ['List item 1', 2]
                >>> print(mylist[-3:-1])
                ['List item 1', 2]
                >>> print(mylist[1:])
                [2, 3.14]
                # Adding a third parameter, "step" will have Python step in
                # N item increments, rather than 1.
                # E.g., this will return the first item, then go to the third and
                # return that (so, items 0 and 2 in 0-indexing).
                >>> print(mylist[::2])
                ['List item 1', 3.14]

                <p>
                    Its strings can use either single or double quotation marks, and you can have quotation marks of one
                    kind inside a string that uses the other kind (i.e. “He said ’hello’.” is valid). Multiline strings
                    are enclosed in _triple double (or single) quotes_ (“”“). Python strings are always Unicode, but
                    there is another string type that is pure bytes. Those are called bytestrings and are represented
                    with the <span class="gray">b</span> prefix, for example <span class="gray">b'Hello
                        \xce\xb1'</span>.. To fill a string with values, you use the %
                    (modulo) operator and a tuple. Each %s gets replaced with an item from the tuple, left to right, and
                    you can also use dictionary substitutions, like so:
                </p>
                <code>
                >>> print("Name: %s\
                Number: %s\
                String: %s" % (myclass.name, 3, 3 * "-"))
                Name: Stavros
                Number: 3
                String: ---

                strString = """This is

                # WARNING: Watch out for the trailing s in "%(key)s".
                >>> print("This %(verb)s a %(noun)s." % {"noun": "test", "verb": "is"})
                This is a test.

                >>> name = "Stavros"
                >>> "Hello, {}!".format(name)
                Hello, Stavros!
                >>> print(f"Hello, {name}!")

                <p>
                    Flow control statements are <span class="gray">if</span>, <span class="gray">for</span>, and <span

                <p>Functions are <span class="dark">declared with the</span> <span class="gray">def</span> keyword.
                    <span class="dark">Optional arguments</span> are set in the function declaration
                    after the mandatory arguments by being assigned a default value. For <span class="dark">named
                        arguments</span>, the name of
                    the argument is assigned a value. Functions can return a tuple (and using tuple unpacking you can
                    effectively return multiple values). <span class='dark'>Lambda functions</span> are ad hoc functions
                    that are comprised of a

                    Python supports a limited form of <span class="dark">multiple inheritance</span> in classes. <span
                        class="dark">Private variables and methods</span> can
                    be declared (by convention, this is not enforced by the language) by adding a leading underscore

                    to class instances. An example follows:

                    <li>Global variables are declared outside of functions and can be read without any special
                        declarations, but if you want to write to them you must declare them at the beginning of the
                        function with the <span class="gray">global</span> keyword, otherwise Python will bind that
                        object to a new local variable
                        (be careful of that, it’s a small catch that can get you if you don’t know it). For example:

                    This tutorial is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all (or even a subset) of Python. Python has
                    a vast array of libraries and much much more functionality which you will have to discover through
                    other means, such as the excellent book <a

                    Python easier. Please leave comments if you believe there is something that could be improved or
                    added or if there is anything else you would like to see (classes, error handling, anything).
