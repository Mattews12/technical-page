                <p>Python is strongly typed (i.e. types are enforced), dynamically, implicitly typed (i.e. you don’t
                    have to declare variables), case sensitive (i.e. var and VAR are two different variables) and
                    object-oriented (i.e. everything is an object).

                <p>Help in Python is always available right in the interpreter. If you want to know how an object works,
                    all you have to do is call help( &ltobject&gt )! Also useful are dir(), which shows you all the
                    object’s methods, and &ltobject&gt.__doc__, which
                    shows you its documentation string:
                </p>
                <code>
                >>> help(5)
                Help on int object:
                (etc etc)

                >>> dir(5)
                ['__abs__', '__add__', ...]

                >>> abs.__doc__
                'abs(number) -> number

                Return the absolute value of the argument.

                <p>Python has no mandatory statement termination characters and blocks are specified by indentation.
                    Indent to begin a block, dedent to end one. Statements that expect an indentation level end in a
                    colon (:). Comments start with the pound (#) sign and are single-line, multi-line strings are used
                    for multi-line comments. Values are assigned (in fact, objects are bound to names) with the equals
                    sign (“=”), and equality testing is done using two equals signs (“==”). You can increment/decrement
                    values using the += and -= operators respectively by the right-hand amount. This works on many
                    datatypes, strings included. You can also use multiple variables on one line. For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    >>> myvar = 3
                    >>> myvar += 2
                    >>> myvar
                    5
                    >>> myvar -= 1
                    >>> myvar
                    4
                    """This is a multiline comment.
                    The following lines concatenate the two strings."""
                    >>> mystring = "Hello"
                    >>> mystring += " world."
                    >>> print(mystring)
                    Hello world.
                    # This swaps the variables in one line(!).
                    # It doesn't violate strong typing because values aren't
                    # actually being assigned, but new objects are bound to
                    # the old names.
                    >>> myvar, mystring = mystring, myvar

                <p>
                    The data structures available in python are lists, tuples and dictionaries. Sets are available in
                    the sets library (but are built-in in Python 2.5 and later). Lists are like one-dimensional arrays
                    (but you can also have lists of other lists), dictionaries are associative arrays (a.k.a. hash
                    tables) and tuples are immutable one-dimensional arrays (Python “arrays” can be of any type, so you
                    can mix e.g. integers, strings, etc in lists/dictionaries/tuples). The index of the first item in
                    all array types is 0. Negative numbers count from the end towards the beginning, -1 is the last
                    item. Variables can point to functions. The usage is as follows:
                </p>
                <code>
                >>> sample = [1, ["another", "list"], ("a", "tuple")]
                >>> mylist = ["List item 1", 2, 3.14]
                >>> mylist[0] = "List item 1 again" # We're changing the item.
                >>> mylist[-1] = 3.21 # Here, we refer to the last item.
                >>> mydict = {"Key 1": "Value 1", 2: 3, "pi": 3.14}
                >>> mydict["pi"] = 3.15 # This is how you change dictionary values.
                >>> mytuple = (1, 2, 3)
                >>> myfunction = len
                >>> print(myfunction(mylist))
                3
            </code>
                <p>You can access array ranges using a colon (:). Leaving the start index empty assumes the first item,
                    leaving the end index assumes the last item. Indexing is inclusive-exclusive, so specifying [2:10]
                    will return items [2] (the third item, because of 0-indexing) to [9] (the tenth item), inclusive (8
                    items). Negative indexes count from the last item backwards (thus -1 is the last item) like so:</p>
                <code>
                >>> mylist = ["List item 1", 2, 3.14]
                >>> print(mylist[:])
                ['List item 1', 2, 3.1400000000000001]
                >>> print(mylist[0:2])
                ['List item 1', 2]
                >>> print(mylist[-3:-1])
                ['List item 1', 2]
                >>> print(mylist[1:])
                [2, 3.14]
                # Adding a third parameter, "step" will have Python step in
                # N item increments, rather than 1.
                # E.g., this will return the first item, then go to the third and
                # return that (so, items 0 and 2 in 0-indexing).
                >>> print(mylist[::2])
                ['List item 1', 3.14]

                <p>
                    Its strings can use either single or double quotation marks, and you can have quotation marks of one
                    kind inside a string that uses the other kind (i.e. “He said ’hello’.” is valid). Multiline strings
                    are enclosed in _triple double (or single) quotes_ (“”“). Python strings are always Unicode, but
                    there is another string type that is pure bytes. Those are called bytestrings and are represented
                    with the b prefix, for example b'Hello \xce\xb1'. . To fill a string with values, you use the %
                    (modulo) operator and a tuple. Each %s gets replaced with an item from the tuple, left to right, and
                    you can also use dictionary substitutions, like so:
                </p>
                <code>
                >>> print("Name: %s\
                Number: %s\
                String: %s" % (myclass.name, 3, 3 * "-"))
                Name: Stavros
                Number: 3
                String: ---

                strString = """This is
                a multiline
                string."""

                # WARNING: Watch out for the trailing s in "%(key)s".
                >>> print("This %(verb)s a %(noun)s." % {"noun": "test", "verb": "is"})
                This is a test.

                >>> name = "Stavros"
                >>> "Hello, {}!".format(name)
                Hello, Stavros!
                >>> print(f"Hello, {name}!")
                Hello, Stavros!
